My research is focused on the advancement of composite materials and structural systems, emphasizing the intricate mechanics and processing techniques required to enhance material performance. I specialize in the deterioration science of polymers and composites, investigating the degradation mechanisms that affect long-term reliability. 

My work in bio-materials aims to integrate sustainable materials into engineering solutions, while my research on multi-threat mitigation addresses the challenges of developing resilient systems capable of withstanding extreme conditions, such as blast impacts. I employ advanced methodologies in nondestructive assessment and wireless sensing to enable real-time structural health monitoring and accurate damage prognosis, which are critical for extending the operational lifespan of aerospace and other high-performance structures. Through a rigorous approach to materials science and engineering, my research seeks to ensure the durability, reliability, and sustainability of next-generation systems.
