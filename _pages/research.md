My research interest is at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) and deals with the problem of establishing standards, measurements, and safeguards for AI-enabled 
software systems (AI systems). My research aims to address quality challenges in AI systems using software engineering principles and methodologies to guarantee trustworthy and responsible AI systems.
I am particularly interested in advancing the state of the art in evaluating AI systems and developing methods, approaches, and tools to test and ensure that AI systems are safe, secure and reliable.
