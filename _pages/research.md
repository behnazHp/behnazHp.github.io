My research focuses on advanced composite materials, additive manufacturing, and materials characterization, built on a multidisciplinary foundation in Civil and Mechanical Engineering. My doctoral work examines the effects of hygrothermal exposure on carbon/epoxy composites, exploring moisture uptake kinetics and its impact on durability, mechanical properties, and glass transition temperature. A two-stage model was developed to predict the long-term performance of these materials under different environmental conditions, contributing to a better understanding of their behavior in practical applications.

My research on materials characterization involves techniques such as SEM, EDS, XRD, FTIR, and thermal analysis to analyze microstructure, phase composition, and mechanical properties of various materials, including those from additive manufacturing. Forensic analysis for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) assesses the chemical and physical properties of concrete and asphalt, providing insights into the effects of aging and environmental exposure. This research aims to predict service life and enhance durability assessments.

In additive manufacturing, research centers on optimizing process parameters for nickel superalloys, particularly Inconel 718, using the EOS M219 machine. This involves refining post-process heat treatments and studying dynamic viscoelasticity, phase transformations, and creep recovery in additively manufactured components. The goal is to enhance material performance for aerospace and industrial applications.
