My research is centered at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI), where I address the critical challenges of establishing standards, measurements, and safeguards for AI-enabled software systems. I am particularly focused on the development of Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, aiming to make machine learning (ML)-based AI systems more transparent and interpretable. My work extends to the testing and debugging of ML based AI-Systems, encompassing critical areas such as privacy testing, security testing, and fairness testing. Ultimately, my research seeks to ensure that AI technologies are not only advanced but also trustworthy, responsible, and aligned with ethical standards.
