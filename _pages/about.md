I am a PhD student at the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), currently ABD (All But Dissertation), working under the guidance of [Dr. Vistasp Karbhari](https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=karbhari). 

My research interests are centered on the processing and mechanics of composites, deterioration science of polymers and composites, bio-materials, multi-threat mitigation (including blast), sustainability, impact/damage/crash energy management, nondestructive assessment, wireless sensing, damage prognosis, and structural health monitoring. I focus on areas such as composites, mechanics, aerospace, and durability.
